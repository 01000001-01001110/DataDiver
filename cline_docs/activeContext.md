# Active Context: Discord Webpage Scraper Bot

## What We're Working On Now

We are currently implementing the core functionality of the Discord Webpage Scraper Bot. This includes:

1. Setting up the Discord bot with slash command support
2. Creating a modal dialog for URL input
3. Integrating the existing HTML-to-Markdown conversion functionality
4. Implementing the content delivery mechanism with format options
5. Ensuring files are properly sent as attachments and then deleted from the server after a reasonable time period
6. Adding webhook logging for all interactions and errors
7. Fixing base64 encoding issues and improving content presentation
8. Adding image extraction functionality
9. Implementing a leaderboard system to track user activity
10. Adding a comprehensive help system for users
11. Containerizing the application with Docker for easier deployment

## Recent Changes

1. Created the initial project structure

    - Created detailed help embeds for each command
    - Included usage instructions and feature explanations
    - Added visual elements like emojis for better readability
    - Organized help content into multiple embeds for clarity
19. Containerized the application with Docker:
    - Created a Dockerfile with Node.js and Python environments
    - Added Chrome and ChromeDriver for Selenium
    - Set up Docker Compose for easier deployment
    - Configured volume mounts for persistent data
    - Updated documentation with Docker setup instructions

## Next Steps

1. **Testing and Refinement**:
   - Test the bot with various types of websites
   - Refine the HTML-to-Markdown conversion for better output quality
   - Optimize the scraping process for speed and reliability
   - Verify file cleanup works properly in all scenarios
   - Test webhook logging functionality
   - Test the handling of large webpages and multiple file parts
   - Test image extraction with various websites
   - Test the leaderboard functionality with multiple users
   - Test the help system for clarity and completeness
   - Test the Docker container in different environments

2. **Feature Enhancements**:
   - Add option to include/exclude specific elements (headers, lists, tables, etc.)
   - Implement a caching mechanism to avoid re-scraping recently accessed pages
   - Add support for authentication-required websites
   - Create a command to list recently scraped pages
   - Add image filtering options (size, type, etc.)
   - Enhance the leaderboard with additional statistics and filtering options

3. **User Experience Improvements**:
   - Add progress updates for long-running scraping operations
   - Improve error messages with more specific troubleshooting advice
   - Create a settings command for user preferences
   - Add personalized statistics for individual users

4. **Deployment and Maintenance**:
   - Set up continuous deployment
   - Implement logging for monitoring and debugging
   - Create automated tests
   - Establish a process for updating dependencies

## Current Challenges

1. Handling JavaScript-heavy websites that may require special handling
2. Managing Discord's message size limitations for large webpages
3. Ensuring the bot can handle high traffic without rate limiting
4. Maintaining clean, readable output across various website structures
5. Balancing file retention time for user convenience with server storage efficiency
6. Ensuring webhook logging doesn't impact bot performance for large files
7. Handling very large webpages that need to be split into multiple parts
8. Preventing base64 encoding issues in the conversion process
9. Managing Discord's rate limits when sending multiple image batches
10. Handling websites with many images efficiently
11. Ensuring the leaderboard data persists correctly across bot restarts
12. Keeping help documentation up-to-date with new features
13. Ensuring Docker container has appropriate resource limits and performance
